[_16.50 Introduction to Propulsion Systems_](/courses/16-50-introduction-to-propulsion-systems-spring-2012)

Course Description
------------------

This course covers the fundamentals of rocket propulsion and discusses advanced concepts in space propulsion ranging from chemical to electrical thrusters. Topics include advanced mission analysis, physics and engineering of microthrusters, solid propellant rockets, electrothermal, electrostatic, and electromagnetic schemes for accelerating propellant. Additionally, satellite power systems and their relation to propulsion systems are discussed. The course includes laboratory work emphasizing the design and characterization of electric propulsion engines.

Training Requirements
---------------------

For the laboratory project, students were required to go through the [MIT-EHS](https://ehs.mit.edu/site/) safety training before gaining access to the laboratory. In addition, specific training at the MIT [Space Propulsion Laboratory (SPL)](http://spl.mit.edu/) was required.
